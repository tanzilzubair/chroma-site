                <strong>Hello and welcome to Chroma!</strong>
                <br><br>
                Now, before we get to the good stuff, I'd like to take a moment to thank you for choosing to use my
                little app, and tell you that this choice means a lot to me, and that I won't let you down.
                With that being said, let's move on to the changes!
                <br><br>
                Do note however, that, for iOS users, this will be the first version of the app publicly available, so
                this
                isn't going to be a list of <em>changes</em> so much so as a list of <em>features</em>.
            </p>

            <p class="info-subtitle">
                A Completely Overhauled UI
            </p>
            <p class="info-content">
                Taking the best of what made the previous UI good, and infusing it with custom, purpose-built designs
                honed with industry standard best practices and principles: built to be an absolute <em>joy</em> to use.
                <br><br>
                Listen, I could talk about it all day, but I think we'd both much rather that you go and experience it
                for yourself!
            </p>
            <ul class="whats-new-list">
                <li>
                    A more unified, minimal UI with complementary colors, beautiful fonts and everything from buttons,
                    labels, menus, and animations; <strong><em>everything</em></strong>, redesigned and rebuilt better
                    than
                    ever.
                </li>
                <li>
                    Sounds and haptics; the app has <strong><em>both</em></strong> now. Carefully made,
                    tested and implemented from the ground up to enrich the user
                    experience: giving more context to available actions and more intuitive
                    feedback on chosen ones.
                </li>
                <li>
                    Autocomplete that is straight up beautifully animated, full of personality, and that Just Worksâ„¢.
                    That's all I'll say, because it's easier if you go and experience it for yourself!
                </li>
                <li>So many small and medium sized things, we'd be here all day if I listed them; so, go ahead and just
                    enjoy them</li>
            </ul>
            <p class="info-subtitle">
                A Radically Redesigned Backend
            </p>
            <p class="info-content">Because although taking on this much work at once may have caused me to question my
                sanity, err
                <em>several</em> times, what good is overhauling one part of the app, if its forced to drag around the
                obsolete and
                burdensome other half everywhere it goes?
            </p>
            <ul class="whats-new-list">
                <li>
                    <strong><em>The Apollo Engine</em></strong>, a redesigned and completely rewritten, modular, query
                    and response parsing engine, with more concise, faster running logic than ever before, more
                    unit-conversion options on top of the current ones, and of course, more resiliency to errors.
                </li>
                <li>
                    Distributed, load-balanced and beefed up servers, running on demand, all over the world, enabling
                    ultra-fast, sub-second responses <strong><em>globally</em></strong>.
                </li>
                <li>
                    A lot of minor improvements, logic streamlining, bug fixes, performance improvements, etc. etc. to
                    round out the backend
                    redesign.
                </li>
                <li>Many, many smaller and larger changes under the hood, that enable some of the new features coming
                    soon!</li>
            </ul>
            <p class="info-subtitle">Other Improvements</p>
            <ul class="whats-new-list">
                <li>
                    <strong><em>A whole lot of personality</em></strong>; specifically, in the little things: a trivia
                    section
                    curated, formatted and fact-checked by yours truly, and, all too familiar locations as examples on
                    the autocomplete field,
                    for example.
                </li>
                <li>
                    Advanced configuration settings, for all you weather buffs who want them.
                </li>
                <li>
                    A brand new splash screen, app icon, app store descriptions and images, among other things, to
                    really <em>complete</em> the redesign.
