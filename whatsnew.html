                <strong>Hello and welcome to Chroma!</strong>
                <br><br>
                Now, before we get to the good stuff, I'd like to take a moment to thank you for choosing to use my
                little app, and tell you that this choice means a lot to me, and that I won't let you down.
                With that being said, let's move on to the good stuff!
                <br><br>
                Do note however, that, since this is the <em>first</em> version of the app publicly available,
                this
                isn't going to be a list of <em>changes</em> so much so as a list of <em>features</em>.
            </p>

            <p class="info-subtitle">
                Beautiful, responsive UI
            </p>
            <p class="info-content">
                Custom, purpose-built designs
                honed with industry standard best practices and principles, and enriched with all of the trail-by-fire
                experience
                I got from <a href="https://caelum.tanzilzubair.tech" target="_blank">Caelum</a>,: built to be smooth,
                a joy to look at and use, and <em>responsive</em>.
                <br><br>
                I could talk about it all day, from the carefully chosen colors, to the painstaking process of inlcuding
                a chosen chroma in specific little nooks of the UI as accents, but I think we'd both much rather that
                you go and experience it
                for yourself!

            <ul class="whats-new-list">
                <li>
                    A unified, minimal UI with colored accents, beautiful font choices and smooth animations
                </li>
                <li>
                    Polished, clean sounds and contextual haptics; carefully made,
                    tested and implemented from the ground up to enrich the user
                    experience: giving more context to available actions and more intuitive
                    feedback on chosen ones.
                </li>
                <li>
                    Smooth, fast refresh painting and text editing, blurring the boundary between thinking and putting
                    to
                    paper.
                </li>
                <li>
                    An incredibly smooth, animated floating text bar, that appears above the keyboard and gives you your
                    formatting options: from bold text to italics, underlines, strikethroughs, blockquotes, lists, and
                    more!
                </li>
                <li>So many tiny and not-so-tiny sized things, we'd be here all day if I listed them; so, go ahead and
                    just
                    enjoy them!</li>

            <p class="info-subtitle">
                Introducing <em>Scribe</em> & <em>Gloss</em>
            </p>
            <p class="info-content">That's right, <strong><em>dual</em></strong> custom-built engines, built from the
                ground up and
                optimized specifically for fast edits and loads, with seamless autosave, while building in fallbacks,
                security, reliability and of
                course,
                a <em>huge</em> number of features.
                <br><br>
                <strong><em>Scribe</em></strong> handles all the intricacies (and frustrating complexities) of Chroma's
                lightweight and incredibly versatile
                text editor, while <strong><em>Gloss</em></strong> powers Chroma's
                beautiful painting capabilities and tools.
                <br><br>
                Taking on this much work at once may have caused me to question my
                sanity, err
                <em>several</em> times, but I've come to find that while this results in frustration and pressure in
                heaps,
                the innovation and grit it fosters, and the limits I break past while in the process, make it so that
                when all is said and done, I'd rather not be doing anything else.
            </p>
            <ul class="whats-new-list">
                <li>
                    <strong><em>Scribe</em></strong>, a custom built text parsing, formatting and storing
                    engine, capable of fast edits, continuous efficient autosave, and built with beautiful text
                    displaying capabilities, along with the usual bells and whistles: strong security and reliability,
                    baked in extensibility and modularity (<em>expect new features and options soon!</em>)
                    and of course, a light-weight, mobile friendly footprint to cap it all off.
                </li>
                <li>
                    <strong><em>Gloss</em></strong>, the counter-part to Scribe, a fast, lightweight and responsive
                    painting engine
                    with low latency drawing capabilities, a focused set of drawing tools to choose from,
                    and of course, the basics: seamless, continous autosave ensuring you never lose your thoughts,
                    strong security and reliability, and the ability for us to iterate and bring you more features at a
                    blistering rate!
                </li>
                <li>
                    Tons of smaller features complementing these powerful engines and making it easier to make them work
                    <em>for</em> you.
                </li>
                <li>Many, many smaller and larger changes under the hood, that enable some of the new features coming

                <li>
                    A nuanced color-blind mode. Chroma is based on color, its magic coming from the vibrancy they offer;
                    we feel
                    it a crime if we did not try our best to make sure <em>everyone</em> could enjoy and come to love it
                    as much as
                    we do.
                </li>
                <li>
                    Tons of subtle, contextual animations, a plethora of font family and font size choices, and a

                    formatting mode to ease distractions!
